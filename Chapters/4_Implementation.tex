\subsection{Implemented Systems repositories}
You can easily download my already implemented system for test it and better understand how it works.

Link for Total implementation Experiment 1 : \\
\url{https://github.com/Sprea22/Data_Analyzer_Python}

Link for Total implementation Experiment 2 : \\
\url{https://github.com/Sprea22/Forecasting_System_Python}

\textbf{How to download and test it:}\\
There are two ways for download it:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download the ZIP files from the following links:\\

Direct link for the already implemented Data Analyzer in Python.\\
\url{https://codeload.github.com/Sprea22/Data_Analyzer_Python/zip/master}\\

Direct link for the already implemented Forecasting System in Python.\\
\url{https://codeload.github.com/Sprea22/Forecasting_System_Python/zip/master}

\newpage
\item If you have already installed github on your computer, you can easily download it creating a folder and then inside that folder open a terminal shell and execute the following commands:\\
\begin{lstlisting}
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sprea22/
		Data\_Analyzer\_Python.git
git pull origin master
\end{lstlisting}

Otherwise:\\

\begin{lstlisting}
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sprea22/
		Forecasting\_System\_Python.git
git pull origin master
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

Once you downloaded it you will find a readMe inside both the repository that will explain your how to execute and how to test it.

\part{Data collection and validation}

\section{Data collection}
\subsection{Data sources}
During this phase of the work the most important thing is to collect as much useful data as possible.The data have been searched on different websites, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item fiskeridir.no (7 Inputs): \\ This has been the main data source for this work. It provides several statistics about Aquaculture in Norway. The only complications about this website are:
\begin{itemize}
\item XLSX Format: The data are available just in XLSX format, with a lot of comments and county categories.
\item Language: The data are available just in Norwegian.
\item Download: Is not possible to implement a script for automatic download of the data since there isn't a static download link for the latest version.
\item Upload frequency: The data are periodically uploaded once per month.
\end{itemize}

\item indexmundi.com (1 input):\\ Is possible to find data about fish (salmon) monthly price, Norwegian Krone per Kilogram.

\item quandl.com (0 Input):\\ Is possible to find data about fish (salmon) monthly price, US Dollar per Kilogram.

\item kart.fiskeridir.no (0 Input):\\ It allows to show some data about Aquaculture in Norway displayed on a map, and is also possible to download it (not every single data) in XLSX/CSV format. 

\item sildelaget.no (0 Input):\\ This website provides some general statistics about fisheries and also a catch journal.

\end{itemize}


\section{Increase accessibility and availability of data}
Quite complicated datasets structure rebuilt in a easy readable way, provided an accurate description (in English, since it was available just in Norwegian) and collected in a unique big dataset. \\
It allows to access to different kind of values about aquaculture in Norway in a much easier way.

\part{Future Works}
\section{Dataset about single locality}
This thesis allows to have a general overview and predictions of values about the aquaculture business in Norway. 

But it would be much more useful, in particular for people into the aquaculture business, to use this system to have an overview and predictions of data provided by a single locality of aquaculture.\\
In this case the system could be used from the owner of the locality to analyze historic values and use the prediction system to have a forecast about some particular parameters.

\section{Visualization of the data}

\section{Test prediction system with a bigger dataset}

\newpage

\section{Prediction system as a service}
This system has been developed with the idea that it could become a "Service system", that is basically a configuration of technology and organizational networks designed to deliver services that satisfy the needs or wants of customers.
Since the prediction system implemented during this work is almost 100\% reusable, it could be used from people for prediction about any kind of data. 

Basically the idea is to create a web application that allows to let you upload your own dataset, choose your own preferences and prediction settings, and then the system will calculate and display prediction of the current values in the future together with the MAPE (Mean Average Percentage Error) to have an idea bout how accurate are the.\\
