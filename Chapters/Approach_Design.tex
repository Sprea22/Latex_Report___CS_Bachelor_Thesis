\chap{Implementation Design and Requirements}

\section{System Requirements}
In the next chapters the implementation procedure for each of the system used for this study will be documented. In order to be able to redo the procedure or just simply test the final resulting systems, it's necessary to comply the following requirements.

\subsection{Requirements for reusability}
\vspace{-5mm}
In order to let the implemented Python systems works in a good way, there is just one important requirement about the possible input datasets that has to be satisfied :
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Monthly frequency of data values.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}
\subsection{System requirements}
\vspace{-5mm}
It's important to remind that this procedure will describe the system implementation using Python, so be sure to have installed all the necessary software to compile and execute Python code on your platform. Current development environment:
\begin{lstlisting}
Python version: 2.7.12
\end{lstlisting}

It's also necessary to have installed the following Python libraries:
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
\item  SciPy \footnote{SciPy : \url{https://www.scipy.org/install.html}}
\item Cartopy \footnote{Cartopy : \url{http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html\#installing}}
\item Statsmodels \footnote{Statsmodels : \url{http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html}}
\end{itemize}

\section{System Design}
\label{System_Design}
As described in the Thesis Structure section \ref{Thesis_Strucutre}, the implemented Python system has been divided in different subsystems. This decision was taken because the system has to implement functions and utilities that are quite different between them, so split it in subsytems allows to maintain the reusability and increase the understanding of the implemented code.
The following figure and text provide a general idea about the systems that are implemented during this study.\\

\begin{itemize}

 \item \textbf{Single Input Analyzer (SIA)}: Will provide the analysis results about a specific parameter of the input dataset.
 \item \textbf{Multiple Input Analyzer (MIA)}: Will provide the analysis results about all the parameters of the input dataset, such as the correlation coefficients between different parameters and comparison of their normalized angular coefficients. 
 \item \textbf{Map}: Will provide a data visualization able to display some of the data on a Norway's territory map.
 \item \textbf{ARIMA-Evaluate}: Will provide a system able to evaluation different configurations of an ARIMA machine about a specific parameter of the current input dataset.
 \item \textbf{ARIMA-Future}: Will provide a system able to get some future predictions about a parameter of the current input dataset using a specific configuration of the ARIMA machine, that should be the best one obtained during the Evaluation process.
\end{itemize}
