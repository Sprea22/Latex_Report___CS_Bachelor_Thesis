\chap{Introduction}


\section{Aim of the study}
Every single day in the world is produced a huge amount of data: some of this data, if they are analyzed and interpreted in the right away, could provide useful informations.\\
If we watch for example at the Aquaculture business in Norway is produced a big amount of data about every single locality or about national statistcs, but most of the time this data are not analyzed and difficult to understand.\\
The main purposes of this thesis are basically to test and show:
\begin{itemize} 
 \item 	Data potential in Aquaculture business in Norway through a system for analyzing and displaying data, in order to help the companies related with Aquaculture to improve their operations thanks to the analysis results.
 \item 	Python potential in data science, in order to show the people how it works and what you could do using it.
 \end{itemize}
For achieve the goals reported above, this thesis will provide:
\begin{itemize} 
 \item 	Implementation and description of a procedure that can be used for make a Python system able to do an initial analysis of  big datasets and also to display the obtained results.
 \item Implementation and description of a procedure that can be used for make a system implemented in Python able to predict futureâ€™s values using a regression model.
 \item List of possible implementation for further uses of machine learning algorithms and regression model.
 
 \end{itemize}
