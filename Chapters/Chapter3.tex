\chap{Development Method}

In order to achieve the problem reported in the introduction, has been developed an easy but clear plan (how you can see in the follow picture 3.1).\\

\textbf{1st Phase: Data collection}
During this phase the most important thing is to gather as much as possible data, 	but they must be as much as possible reliable and useful they are going to be indispensable for the next phases and in particular the final result and conclusion.
The data’s reliability and utility mainly depend by the kind of sources where you’re able to mine.

\textbf{2nd Phase: Dataset creation}
During this phase you should customize the unstructured data that you collected in the first phase. This data’s customizing has the main purpose to let the data structure follow some kind of setting and standard needed in the system that will be implemented later on.
Part of this phase has to be done meanwhile you’re working on the successive phase, since you’re going to discover a lot of needed setting and standard once you’re trying to feed the system.

\textbf{3rd Phase: Data analysis}
During this phase the first thing that you’re going to do is to decide some kind of analysis results that you would like to have.
Once you decided which kind of results you might reach, you will start with the analysis system implementation and then for the predictions system.

	\qquad \textbf {3.1rd Phase – Initial data analysis system:}

	\qquad \textbf {3.2rd Phase – Data prediction system:}

\textbf{4th Phase: Data displaying}
This is the last but not least phase since displaying some information in a easy-read mode sometimes is very difficult.
During this phase the main purpose will be to find a way to display the analysis results in a way that could be easily understand.

	\qquad \textbf {4.1th Phase - Initial analysis results displaying}
	
	\qquad \textbf {4.2th Phase - Prediction results displaying}
