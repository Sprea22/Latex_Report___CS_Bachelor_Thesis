\section{Data sources}
The collection of the data has been an important phase during this work. \\
Several sources have been checked and consulted in order to find reliable and useful data for the final purpose of this thesis.\\
In this particular case the main data collection way was internet, but some important data have been provided also from SINTEF Nord.


\subsection{Data from SINTEF Nord}
Some of the data used during this thesis were provided from the team members of the eSushi project team at SINTEF Nord. \\
The data are about each single norwegian county and with the following details:\\

\end{tabular}}}

\subsection{Data from Fiskeridir} 
The current website has been the main data source for this work. It provides several statistics about Aquaculture in Norway.\\
The data inputs from the current website used for this thesis are reported below, and they are available for each single county in Norway involved in Aquaculture business:

It's also important to know that the following informations about this current data source:
\begin{itemize}
\item The data are available from 2005 to 2017.
\item The data are uploaded once per month.
\item The data are reported and available just in XLSX format.
\item The data are available just in Norwegian.
\item Is not possible to implement an automatic download script.
\end{itemize}

\section{Increase accessibility and availability of data}
In order to increase the accessibility and availability of the row data have been downloaded from the above reported sources, during this phase the main goals were:
\begin{itemize}
\item provide an accurate description (in English, since it was available just in Norwegian)
\item Report the data in a standard and reusable standard (CSV).
\item Design and build a easily readable dataset structure.
\end{itemize} 

The final decision about the datasets set up during this thesis provided the followng list of datasets, where the structure can be checked in the following two pages:
