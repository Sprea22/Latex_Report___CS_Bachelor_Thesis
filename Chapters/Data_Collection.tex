\section{Data Sources}
The collection of the data has been an important phase during this work. \\
Several sources have been checked and consulted in order to find reliable and useful data for the final purpose of this thesis.\\
In this particular case the main data collection way was internet, but some important data have been provided also from SINTEF Nord.

\subsection{Data from SINTEF Nord}
Some of the data used during this thesis were provided from the members of the eSushi project at SINTEF Nord.
The origin source of the data is "Archieve Norstore"\footnote{Source link for data downloaded by Archieve Norstore: \\\url{https://archive.norstore.no/pages/public/datasetDetail.jsf?id=10.11582/2015.00014}} and they are about each single norwegian county with the following details:\\

\subsection{Data from Fiskeridir} 
Fiskeridir\footnote{Source link for data downloaded by Fiskeridir: \\ \url{http://www.fiskeridir.no/Akvakultur/Statistikk-akvakultur/Biomassestatistikk}} has been the main data source for this work. It provides several statistics about Aquaculture in Norway.\\
The data inputs from the current website used for this thesis are reported below, and they are available for each single county in Norway involved in Aquaculture business:

\begin{table}[ht]
\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
\resizebox{1.2\textwidth}{!}{
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | l |}
            \hline
\textbf{Input}							&	\textbf{Content}	& \textbf{Unit} & \textbf{Frequency} & \textbf{Available Period} \\ \hline
1. Cages							&	\multicolumn{1}{p{4cm}|}{\raggedright Reported number of cages with salmon and rainbow trout.}
									& Number & Monthly & January 2005 - April 2017 	\\ \hline									
2. Localities						& \multicolumn{1}{p{4cm}|}{\raggedright Reported number of localities with salmon and rainbow trout.}

7. Salmon Number 		& \multicolumn{1}{p{4cm}|}{\raggedright Reported number of Salmon. }		
									& Number & Monthly & January 2007 - April 2017  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}}}\\
     \caption{Data provided from Fiskeridir.}
    \label{table: Fiskeridir_Data} 
\end{table}  
    
About the current data source is also important to know that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The data are available from 2005 to 2017.
\item The data are uploaded once per month.
\item The data are reported and available just in XLSX format.
\item The data are available just in Norwegian.
\item Is not possible to implement an automatic download script.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data from Indexmundi} 
An another source of data for this study was Indexmundi\footnote{Source link for data downloaded by Indexmundi: \\ \url{http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=fish}}. From this particular source is possible to get data about fish (salmon) monthly price, Norwegian Krone per KG.\\

\begin{table}[ht]
\makebox[\textwidth][c]{
\resizebox{1.2\textwidth}{!}{
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | l |}
            \hline
\textbf{Input}	 &	\textbf{Content}	& \textbf{Unit} & \textbf{Frequency} & \textbf{Available Period} \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|p{4cm}|}{\raggedright 1. Export Salmon Price}	&	
\multicolumn{1}{p{4cm}|}{\raggedright Reported farm bred Norwegian Salmon export price.}

\end{tabular}}}

\section{Increase accessibility and availability of data}
In order to increase the accessibility and availability of the downloaded data, during this phase the main goals were:
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}
 \setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
\item Provide an accurate description in English language, since most of the data were available just in Norwegian.
\item Report the data in a standard and reusable format (CSV).
\item Design and build a easily readable dataset structure.
\end{itemize} 

The final decision about the datasets set up during this thesis provided the followng list of datasets, where the structure can be checked in the following two pages.
\vspace{-2mm}
 \setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Overview Dataset: Norway.csv

\subsection{Dataset about single county}

        \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Files/Dataset2.pdf}}
    \caption{Dataset structure.}
\end{figure}

How is possible to check in the following table, the dataset that contains data about a single county has a shorter availability period of the values than the dataset about Norway, that is because of the sea average temperature values that have shorter range compared with the other inputs (2007-2014 instead of 2005-2016).
