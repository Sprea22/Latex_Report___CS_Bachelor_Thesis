\chap{Introduction}

During the last few years we have witnessed an ever-increasing production of data in any sector all around the world.
For this reason instruments and techniques for analyzing and understanding these data are becoming more and more indispensable, in order to extract useful information that might be used to improve business strategies or people's life condition.

Data Science is a field which contains processes and systems that could be used to extract knowledge from data, either structured or unstructured. Since the newness of this field, would be interesting to test and evaluate different ways to apply daily technologies to its procedures and systems.

Python is a well-known interpreted, object-oriented and high-level programming language that has a easy to learn syntax.
Since it provides severals modules and package, the use of Python during a Data Science process could be very productive.

The processes and systems which belong to the Data Science field might be applied to high-interest  economic areas, such as the Aquaculture industry in Norway.
This business, in particular the Norwegian salmon aquaculture, has a big economic repercussions on the country and at the same time is producing a huge amount of data, so it would be extremely helpful to restructure and analyze it.

This thesis will contribute providing a documented implementation of an analysis, displaying and prediction system using Python applied to the Norwegian salmon farming.

\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{Thesis_Strucutre}
\textbf{Background Theory}\\
This section reports the relevant background theory that is necessary for better understand the work done during this thesis.

\textbf{I Part: Data collection and validation}\\
During this initial part of the work the main purpose is to collect as much data as possible. The data have to be related with the current area of interest and at the same time considered reliable. Once enough data are collected, they will be documented and structured in a proper dataset.


\textbf{II Part: System implementation}\\
During this part of the work the Python system is implemented and the procedure is reported, in order to try to find as many answers as possible to the initial goals. The implemented system will be divided in several subsystems to allow an easier implementation procedure and a higher reusability. An overview about the implemented subsystems is provided in the figure [\ref{System_Design}].


\textbf{III Part: Result, Discussion and Conclusions }\\
Once arrived at this part of the study, the results and the relative interpretations are reported. Furthermore, a general summarize about the study is provided, together with some evaluations, challenges, limitations encountered and recommendations for future works.


\textbf{IV Part: Full code Implementation }	\\
In this last part of the study the full commented code implementation for each single system implemented is reported. It would be useful to checkout more details about the code, since during the II Part only the most important rows and functions of the code are reported.


\section{Previous Works}
\vspace{-5mm}
The implementation of the prediction system in this thesis was based on a previous work, which provides a basic implementation of a forecasting system with Python.\\
That particular work was showing how to create a general ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting with Python. During this study that implementation has been improved, customized and applied to the current context.

The previous work source website is named "machinelearningmastery.com" \cite{previousWork}.


\section{Work repository}
\label{Repository}
Before starting to read the implementation procedure about this work, it's important to know that is possible to check out the system's full implementation on Github.\\
I suggest to check out and download the following repository. It allows to test the system and better understand how it is structured and how it works.\\
Further more, it's possible to find inside the same repository all the needed datasets and a "Manual" wich contains the instructions about how to use it.
