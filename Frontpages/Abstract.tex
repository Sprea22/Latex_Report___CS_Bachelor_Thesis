    Moonstone (also known as the wishing stone[1]) is found in a variety of colors. Its supposed magical effects include helping a person gain emotional balance. Since Harry spent much of book five emotionally unbalanced, it is perhaps fitting that he was forced to write an essay on the stone's use in Potions-making. It is a gemstone of medium value. Moonstones are a milky colour and shine very brightly, almost as though they are a source of their own light. They are a useful potion ingredient; powdered moonstones are used as an ingredient for the Draught of Peace and in several Love Potions. Powdered Moonstone is also an ingredient in in Potion No. 86 which is likely an experimental potion. Moonstones were also known to be among the gems set into Muriel's tiara.
