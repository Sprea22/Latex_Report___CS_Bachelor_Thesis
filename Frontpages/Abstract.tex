\chapter{Abstract}

The term Data Science refers to the collection of knowledges and skills, mainly about statistics and computer science, that allow to collect, analyze and display data in order to understand actual phenomena. Since there isn't a default technique to extract informations from the data this study investigates about the possibility of using Python in order to realize a system able to analyze, display and forecast data. \\
This kind of systems are commonly used to elaborate data coming from high-interest area; for instance, during this work was used a dataset about the Norwegian aquaculture industry, since Norway represents the forefront of innovation and development in this area, in particular about the Norwegian salmon farming, and also because this business produces a lot of unstructured and not interpreted data. \\
The implementation procedure reported in this study reveals that Python provides several modules and packages that could be useful for a data analysis and displaying on dataset coming from any kind of area of interest. \\
Further more, this thesis provides several analysis results about each single norwegian county involved in the Norwegian aquaculture business, such as graphics, correlation coefficients, trend line indicators and prediction of the future.
